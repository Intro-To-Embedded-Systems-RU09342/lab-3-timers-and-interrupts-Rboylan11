# TIMER A Blink
The objective of this lab is to make two LEDs blink at different frequencies but this time by use of timers and interrupts. There are two timers used, each in up mode but reset at different values. The reset triggers an interrupt which then toggles the state of the LED. Since these timers reset at different times, the two interrupts are called at different times. Each interrupt toggles the state of one LED. So different interrupt times lead to different blinking frequencies of the LEDs.

The difference in code between the two boards is that there are different pins for the LEDs and buttons. Also, for the FR6989 you must disable the GPIO power-on default high-impedance mode.
