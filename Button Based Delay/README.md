# Button Based Delay
The objective of this lab is to create a frequency based off the length of a button press. Each time the user holds down the button, the LED will blink, staying on for the length of the hold, and going off for the length of the hold, until the button is pressed again. When the button is pressed an interrupt is called that sets a variable "start" to mark the time, then when it is released a variable "end" captures the time. Then a while loop is entered to change the blinking frequency of the LED. When the button is pressed again the interrupt is called again and the process repeats itself.

The difference in code between the two boards is that there are different pins for the LEDs and buttons. Also, for the FR6989 you must disable the GPIO power-on default high-impedance mode.
